            In my interview with  Natalyn Archibong, I asked about her Stance on pricing out legacy families?, she responded with “the East Lake Neighbor in Need Program - helping neighbors maintain homes with dignity (other neighborhoods followed - Kirkwood Cares.). Also about the potential to freeze tax initiatives”. Kirkwood care is a fantastic organization that if your in the kirkwood neighborhood. It helps with the damage to people's houses and gives them a place to stay when it is no longer available while home damages are being paid for. The montara for Neighbors in Need is “Neighbor in Need provides emergency home repairs for low-income elderly homeowners in East Atlanta, allowing them to stay safe and comfortable in their homes” . When they pay for some of their neighbors damages to their homes, so that they can continue to live in them and not end up selling them to flippers who are trying to make a quick buck. And the freezing taxes are for housing taxes due to the fact the retired homeowners get a certain amount of money that is just enough for them to pay their taxes but when areas around them are being gentrified, the land tax gets raised , but there one money doesn’t. This is a new process but could be life saving.
